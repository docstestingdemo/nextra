On the Showcase page, you'll see a list of websites built with Docusaurus. At the top of the page, you'll find various filters to help you browse through the showcased sites. These filters include categories like Favorite, Open-Source, Product, Design, i18n, Versioning, Large, Meta, Personal, and RTL Direction.

You can use these filters to narrow down the sites based on your interests or requirements. The showcase displays 83 sites at the time of this image, but this number may vary.
