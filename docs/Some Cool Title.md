Nextra does not have a specific API in the traditional sense. Instead, it builds upon Next.js and extends its functionality for creating documentation and content-focused websites. Here's an overview of how Nextra works:

1. File-based Routing: 
   Nextra uses Next.js's file-based routing system. Each `.md` or `.mdx` file in the `pages` directory becomes a route in your website.

2. Configuration:
   - `next.config.js`: Used to configure Nextra and its themes.
   - `theme.config.jsx`: Used to customize the appearance and behavior of the chosen theme.

3. Frontmatter:
   YAML frontmatter in Markdown files can be used to set page-specific metadata and options.

4. Built-in Components:
   Nextra provides components like `Callout`, `Tabs`, and `Steps` that can be used directly in MDX files.

5. Theming:
   Nextra supports themes (like docs theme and blog theme) that can be configured to customize the look and feel of your site.

6. MDX Support:
   Allows the use of JSX in Markdown files, enabling the integration of React components.

7. Automatic Table of Contents:
   Generates a table of contents based on the headings in your Markdown files.

8. Search Functionality:
   Provides built-in search capabilities that can be customized.

9. Internationalization:
   Supports i18n for creating multi-language sites.

10. Static Site Generation:
    Leverages Next.js's static site generation capabilities for improved performance.

Instead of providing a traditional API, Nextra focuses on configuration and convention to create powerful documentation and content websites with minimal setup.
